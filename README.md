# Web Synth

### A Juno-Inspired Synthesizer in the Browser

<img src="./assets/ingo-60-synth.png" alt="Web Synth UI" width="100%" />

A web-based synthesizer built with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tone.js**, inspired by the warm, immediate sound and workflow of the classic **Roland JUNO-60**.

This project explores how traditional subtractive synthesis can be re-imagined using modern web technologies and the Web Audio API — no plugins, no installs, just sound.
